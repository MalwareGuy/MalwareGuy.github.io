## Who I am
I am Owen, aka Malware Guy. I stop breaches and kick bad-guy ass for a living. As of right now, I am a blue teamer by trade, and malware reverse engineering is my speciality. I am also a VTuber.

## Where I was
Early days seen me starting off with two apprenticeships, then later dipping into both offensive and defensive backgrounds, which included the SOC, penetration testing and malware development. I started off reading the Practical Malware Analysis book, and later expanded my interest to [Practical Junior Malware Researcher (PJMR)](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pjmr/) developed by [HuskyHacks](https://notes.huskyhacks.dev/), [eLearnSecurity Certified Malware Analysis Professional (eCMAP)](https://my.ine.com/CyberSecurity/learning-paths/e831d3ee-18b5-4b46-b1a7-9f7b3d65feae/malware-analysis-professional) by [INE](https://my.ine.com/), and [Zero2Automated](https://www.0ffset.net/training/zero2auto/) by [0ffset Training Solutions](https://www.0ffset.net/).

## Where I'm going
The paths I taken had not always been easy, but they were not impossible. I will keep on moving in the direction of my purpose and guide others towards their own goals.

## How I will do it
Right now I pursue everything there is to know about malware reverse engineering, threat hunting and digital forensics, and as I learn I'll use this blog as well as my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/malware_guy) streams to share some of the spoils of the hunts, and put everything I had learnt to test by hunting real world malware.

**Whenever you get into a new thing, be sure to embrace the awkwardness that comes with it in the beginning, and remember you're only a few good experiences away.**
