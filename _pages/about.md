My name is Owen. I work as a penetration tester, and I am also a security researcher, currently holding eCTHP, eCPPT and Pentest+.

## Early Career
I started off with two apprenticeships, the first one being an IT tech guy and the other working within the SOC, which both lasted up to two years each. They allowed me to gain on-the-job experience while also obtaining qualifications considered equivalent to college (technically high school for those outside the UK) and university foundation years. As of currently, I have 5 total years of professional technology experience.

Right now I am pursuing malware reverse engineering, threat hunting and digital forensics, and as I keep learning I'll use this blog as well as my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/malware_guy) streams to share the spoils of the hunts.

The paths I taken had not always been easy, but they were not impossible. To keep moving in the direction of my purpose, I take ownership and hold myself accountable for my continuous development, while I also guide others towards their goals.

## How are you learning?
I've read the Practical Malware Analysis book, and I watch Patreon videos from OALabs. I am also working through the [Zero2Automated](https://zero2auto.com) and [Hexorcist](https://www.reverse-engineer.net/hexorcism-training) courses during my free time, and putting everything I had learnt to test by hunting real world malware.
