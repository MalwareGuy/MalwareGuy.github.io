* **Be human, also assume respect from one another.** We all live individual lives and got our own different stories that make up who we are, and we will not always know what the next person could be going through. Banter with each other can be fine, but be mindful of boundaries. Also keep in mind that due to the multitude of topics discussed here, this is a community geared towards **18+ audiences**.

* **Whichever platform you are on, honour their ToS.** Talks that could jeopardise the community are not welcome here.

* **Avoid political or controversial topics.** This is meant to be a community for people of all backgrounds and beliefs to hang out and have fun. Everyone here is considered a friend, so let's stick to more lighthearted topics!

* **Venting** in healthy amounts is fine here. In many cases, venting about things could help you eventually realise you got a solution at hand, and you just needed to be able to release the pressure. As long as you can read the vibe, not ruin the current mood and avoid disclosing too much public information about yourself, getting a few things off your chest like a hard long day at work or stressful uni deadlines is perfectly okay and accepted here, just be reminded that I am no licensed profesional and help should be sought from the right places! **On Discord, you can grab a role for the dedicated channel.**

* **Sharing malware:** If you would like to share some malware, upload the sample to [Malshare](https://malshare.com) then drop the link inside the **#malware-hunting** Discord channel. **Bear in mind I mainly focus on one sample at a time, and prioritise the one I'm working on!** It must also be reminded that all content posted in that channel can contain or relate to live malware and must not be run on live machines. **Users that want access it channel must obtain a special role from a moderator, and are held liable by themselves for the safety of their systems and data!**

 If I do not appreciate something, I will be direct and honest with you to help you realise what you're doing does not conform with the values of my channel and grant an opportunity to change your actions. I trust everyone coming here to keep everything chill and welcoming, and my mods to do a great job in making decisions to ensure all is well. Thank you for being a valuable member of the community!
