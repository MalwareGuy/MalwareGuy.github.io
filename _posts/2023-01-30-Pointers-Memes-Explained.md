What the hell is a pointer!? When I first started learning C and C++, that was the first question that popped into my head. Just like every malware reverse engineer starting out, I was pretty much confused on what they were, particularly since I wrote stuff in Python or C# all the time. As a newbie, I also hated writing in it:

Then I saw this message on Discord, and it dawned on me. I begun to remember some memes my friends and I shared with each other a while ago...

## Regular Pointers

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/pointers/regular-pointer.png" %}

This one should be simple enough! Simply put, pointers **point** to variables containing value. Pointers themselves contain the memory address of the variable they point to, and can be **dereferenced** to retrieve the original value.

The `int*` type causes the compiler to define the `pNumber` variable as a pointer, which would later on contain the value of `Number` by calling it alongside the `&` dereferencing operator. Within the Assembly, you may also notice the `lea` instruction was used to apply the pointer:

## Point to the void

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/pointers/void-pointer.png" %}
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11626786/what-does-void-mean-and-how-to-use-it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11626786/what-does-void-mean-and-how-to-use-it)

A `void *` type points to a memory location that can be converted/casted to any value type - be it a `char`, `int`, `long`, whatever you want the eventual variable type to be! `PVOID` and `LPVOID` are also happen to simply be Windows API `typedef` for the `void*` pointer. For examples when this pointer type is used, think of `VirtualAlloc` in malware when it is unpacking and allocates memory - the result returned would be a blank memory space with either read, write and/or execute permissions depending on the parameters that was passed to the function in the first place!

A similar approach can be taken for strings:

(Console output was practically the same as the last one)

## Pointer pointer

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/pointers/pointer-to-a-pointer.jpg" %}

Within this example, we have two pointers - one that contains the memory address to the original integer value, and another that points to the other pointer (a pointer pointer I guess!?). [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3794236/difference-between-the-int-i-and-int-i)

## An Extremely Volatile Pointer

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/pointers/volatile-pointer.png" %}
*"How did we even get here!?"* - [S1ren](https://sirensecurity.io/blog/) from Offensive Security when she one day randomly catches me alone in VC

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9935190/why-is-a-point-to-volatile-pointer-like-volatile-int-p-useful

This pointer works very similarly to the one from the first section! There is only one difference. as quoted from the almighty [MSDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/const-and-volatile-pointers?view=msvc-170):
*The `volatile` keyword specifies that the value associated with the name that follows can be modified by actions other than those in the user application. Therefore, the `volatile` keyword is useful for declaring objects in shared memory that can be accessed by multiple processes or global data areas used for communication with interrupt service routines.*

*When a name is declared as `volatile`, the compiler reloads the value from memory each time it is accessed by the program. This dramatically reduces the possible optimizations. However, when the state of an object can change unexpectedly, it is the only way to ensure predictable program performance.*

`volatile` pointers have their uses, but as of currently I'm not familiar with them. Technically speaking, the code below should be functionally the same as a regular pointer with minor differences, but in case you're curious about (of course, why wouldn't you be if you've kept reading up to this point?), here's the before and after with the code when it gets **uglified** by IDA!

## Spiderman

While this shit is funny as hell, I won't be evaluating it! 

## Spaghetti Code

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/pointers/weird-pointer.png" %}

The `*(int *)` part casts the variable number to a pointer to an integer type, then the `*` in front dereferences it ([reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4170249/int-num-int-number-what-does-this-do)). I couldn't reproduce this myself, but here's some good docs to understand a bit more about casting, check out these articles:

## Nulling Out
That sums up the RE note for today! Before this gets out of hand, I will be seeing myself out:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/pointers/null-and-void.png" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/pointers/20230123194448.png" %}

`NULL` (essentially `0x0`) - used to terminate strings, programs and lives! You can see how that would be interpreted in Assembly:

## The "Real and True" Conclusion
Okay okay, I get it! Jokes aside, While this seemed like a programming post, I hope it would be helpful to those who are trying to make their way around reverse engineering so they don't need to suffer like I once did! It was pretty fun to write up, and I applied some concepts I learned from Sergei's OALabs Patreon and understood quite a bit more about pointers. For anyone who is already subscribed, make sure to leave some great feedback for him, as feedback helps content creator lives! In my opinion, I genuinely think he's a cool guy and he explains overly technical concepts in a way that helps to people understand. Sergei if you're still reading, I would like you to help me unpack VMP and Armadil-

Pointers offer powerful ways to manage memory (when used correctly). Instead of pushing a value to the stack or assigning it to a register, an argument can take in pointer variables and reference or make changes to the value rather than allocating additional more memory inside the program. This generally happens for several existing methods already, take `VirtualAlloc` and `memcpy` for example. Inside a debugger, if you want to keep track of the data inside a region of memory, simply follow the steps I did in this [overly verbose post](https://www.malwareguy.tech/Hunts/redline-stealer.html#wsaconnect)

Sometimes you may come across these especially if you attempt to decompile and read psuedocode, and it can be very confusing if you're not familiar with C syntax. I myself would do a quick search to understand the behaviour and results of these types of code. Most of the time, you will be dealing with regular pointers, but make sure you keep [this lifesaver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types) right near you!

PS: A handle CAN be a pointer, but never exclusively. The same can't be said for the other way round though, since a *handle* is meant to be built-in Windows functionality that provides access to an *object* ([shamelessly nabbed from MSDN once again](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/handles-and-objects)). You can check the handles that are open inside a process from x64dbg and Process Hacker/System Informer! Be sure to either search for them by their Name and/or Type, and **Refresh** if the window is empty inside the debugger:

Also for anyone who likes light mode Discord or obsessively codes in Java, I would like to have a word with you:

PSS: As if I couldn't fit enough here, I thought I'd also **point** this out! Thanks for the support, and what a time to be alive!
